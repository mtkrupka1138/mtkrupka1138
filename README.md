- 👋 Hi, I’m Meghan. 
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development. I would ideally like to work for a company in the education, creative or health/wellness sector. 
- 🌱 I recently completed a full-stack web development bootcamp. I am currently completing a personal project while reviewing concepts and fundamentals. 
- 💞️ I enjoy doing Frontend Mentor and CodeWar challenges, and I am trying to carve out more time for these, even if it's just a line or two of code a day. 
- 📫 You can reach me at mkrupka.hdm@gmail.com.
