- 👋 Hi, I’m Meghan 
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development. I would like to work for a company in the education, creative or health/wellness sector. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development. However, I am mostly focusing on front-end and becoming a React master!
- 💞️ I enjoy doing Frontend Mentor and HackerRank challenges, and I am trying to carve out more time for these.
